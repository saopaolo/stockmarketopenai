Python code snippet that queries the Finnhub API for the latest stock news and uses the OpenAI ChatGPT API to analyze the sentiment, then identifies the top 25 stocks likely to trend during the London Stock Exchange market open.

Prerequisites:

    Finnhub API Key: Sign up at Finnhub and get your API key.
    OpenAI API Key: Sign up at OpenAI and get your API key.
    
Install necessary packages:

    pip install requests openai

Notes:

    Stock Tickers: You may need to expand the list of tickers based on your requirements. Consider using a more extensive list or fetching them dynamically.
    Sentiment Logic: The sentiment analysis logic is basic; you may want to refine it further based on your needs.
    API Rate Limits: Be mindful of the rate limits for both Finnhub and OpenAI APIs. You may need to implement error handling or rate limiting in production code.

Important:

    Replace YOUR_FINNHUB_API_KEY and YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY with your actual API keys. Adjust the tickers and logic based on your specific requirements for better accuracy.
